## Route Description
Starting at South Lake Union, I walked south towards Pike Place Market, enjoying the vibrant atmosphere and scenic views of the waterfront. Passing by the market's bustling stalls and iconic fish-throwing vendors, I continued down to the pier, where the fresh sea breeze and views of Elliott Bay were refreshing.

From there, I headed towards Lumen Field, taking in the sight of the impressive stadium. After reaching Lumen Field, I turned back and made my way through the heart of downtown Seattle. The walk through the city center showcased a mix of modern skyscrapers, busy streets, and a variety of shops and restaurants.

Finally, I returned to South Lake Union, completing a loop that highlighted Seattle's unique blend of natural beauty and urban energy. The route provided a diverse experience, from the serene lakeside and coastal views to the lively market and downtown cityscape.
