## Route Description
Starting at The Spheres, this walking loop offered a unique tour through some of Seattle's most iconic landmarks. The journey began with the lush, indoor gardens of The Spheres, a tranquil oasis in the heart of the city.

From The Spheres, I headed towards the Museum of History & Industry (MOHAI) in South Lake Union. The walk took me through vibrant city streets and along the waterfront, offering beautiful views of Lake Union. At MOHAI, I explored exhibits showcasing Seattle's rich history and innovation.

Continuing the loop, I made my way towards the Space Needle. The path led me through the lively atmosphere of the Seattle Center, where I could see families enjoying the various attractions and green spaces. The Space Needle, standing tall and iconic, provided a stunning view of the cityscape from its base.

After taking in the sights at the Space Needle, I completed the loop by returning to The Spheres. This walking route offered a blend of natural beauty, historical insight, and urban energy, all within a compact and easily walkable area of Seattle.
