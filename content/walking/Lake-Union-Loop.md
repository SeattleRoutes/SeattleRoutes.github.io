## Route Description
Starting at the Museum of History & Industry (MOHAI) in South Lake Union, this scenic loop around Lake Union offers a variety of activities and sights. Begin your journey with a visit to MOHAI, where you can explore exhibits on Seattle's rich history and innovation.

From MOHAI, walk along the lake's edge heading northwest towards Gas Works Park. As you make your way, enjoy the bustling atmosphere of South Lake Union Park, where you can rent a kayak or paddleboard to experience the lake up close. Continuing on, you'll pass by numerous waterfront restaurants and cafes, perfect for a quick coffee or snack.

Reaching Gas Works Park, take time to explore the park's unique industrial remnants and enjoy panoramic views of the Seattle skyline. The park is a great spot for a picnic, kite flying, or simply relaxing on the grassy hills.

Next, follow the Burke-Gilman Trail east towards the University of Washington. This section of the trail is lined with greenery and offers occasional glimpses of the lake. Along the way, you can stop at the Fremont neighborhood, known for its eclectic public art, quirky shops, and the Fremont Troll sculpture under the bridge.

Continuing to the University of Washington, take a stroll through the beautiful campus. The university's grounds include the picturesque Drumheller Fountain, the cherry blossom-lined paths of the Quad (in season), and the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture.

Heading south, cross the University Bridge and follow the shoreline back towards South Lake Union. This part of the walk offers stunning views of houseboats and sailboats on the lake. You might also consider stopping by Portage Bay Cafe for a meal or visiting the Center for Wooden Boats to see classic wooden vessels.

Finally, return to MOHAI to complete the loop. This route offers a delightful mix of urban landscapes, parkland, and waterfront scenery, with plenty of opportunities for exploration and relaxation along the way.
