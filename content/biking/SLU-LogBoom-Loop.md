The SLU üîÅ Log Boom Park Loop begins in the vibrant neighborhood of South Lake Union (SLU), known for its modern vibe and stunning views of Lake Union. From SLU, you head north along the edge of Lake Union, enjoying the scenic waterfront, and make your way to the iconic Gas Works Park.

Continuing your ride, you travel towards the University of Washington, cycling through the picturesque campus with its lush greenery and historic buildings. This segment offers a blend of urban and natural beauty.

From the UW, you hop onto the Burke-Gilman Trail, a well-maintained and popular multi-use path.
