## Route Description
Starting from South Lake Union, the 43.7-mile biking route began by heading northeast via the scenic Burke-Gilman Trail. The trail offered a smooth, dedicated path with beautiful views of Lake Union and Lake Washington, making it a favorite for cyclists and joggers alike. I followed the trail all the way up to Woodinville, passing through tranquil neighborhoods and lush, green parks.

In Woodinville, the route transitioned to a more suburban setting, with opportunities to explore local wineries and breweries if desired. After a brief stop, I continued the journey by heading south towards the SR 520 bridge. This part of the ride included a mix of suburban and urban landscapes, with well-maintained bike lanes and occasional hills providing a good workout.

Crossing the SR 520 bridge was a highlight, offering stunning views of Lake Washington and the Seattle skyline in the distance. The dedicated bike path on the bridge ensured a safe and enjoyable crossing. After the bridge, the route took me through the neighborhoods of the Eastside before heading back west towards Seattle.

The final stretch of the route led me through familiar city streets, eventually returning to South Lake Union. This loop offered a diverse experience, showcasing Seattle's natural beauty, suburban charm, and urban vibrancy all in one comprehensive ride.
