      <description>Route Description Starting at The Spheres, this walking loop offered a unique tour through some of Seattle&amp;rsquo;s most iconic landmarks. The journey began with the lush, indoor gardens of The Spheres, a tranquil oasis in the heart of the city.&#xA;From The Spheres, I headed towards the Museum of History &amp;amp; Industry (MOHAI) in South Lake Union. The walk took me through vibrant city streets and along the waterfront, offering beautiful views of Lake Union.</description>

      <description>Route Description Starting at South Lake Union, I walked south towards Pike Place Market, enjoying the vibrant atmosphere and scenic views of the waterfront. Passing by the market&amp;rsquo;s bustling stalls and iconic fish-throwing vendors, I continued down to the pier, where the fresh sea breeze and views of Elliott Bay were refreshing.&#xA;From there, I headed towards Lumen Field, taking in the sight of the impressive stadium. After reaching Lumen Field, I turned back and made my way through the heart of downtown Seattle.</description>
